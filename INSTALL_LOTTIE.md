# Install Lottie Animation Library

## Installation Command

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install react-lottie-player
```

OR if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-lottie-player
```

OR if you're using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add react-lottie-player
```

## What I've Done

1. ✅ Added Lottie import to Create.tsx
2. ✅ Added state to load the animation JSON
3. ✅ Updated the under development overlay to use your robot animation
4. ✅ Added fallback to Construction icon if animation fails to load

## After Installation

Once you run the install command, the Lottie animation will automatically display on the Create page!

## Animation Details

- **File**: `/public/robot process automation.json`
- **Size**: 240x240px
- **Loop**: Yes (continuous)
- **Fallback**: Construction icon with pulse animation

## Preview

The animation will replace the construction icon in the "Under Development" overlay on the Create page.
